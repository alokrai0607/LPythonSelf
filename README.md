Installing Python and setting up the development environment is an essential first step in starting your Python programming journey. Python is available for various operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

**Step 1: Download Python:**
- Go to the official Python website: https://www.python.org/downloads/
- Download the latest version of Python. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, Python 3.x is the recommended version.
- Choose the appropriate installer for your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).

**Step 2: Installing Python on Windows:**
- Double-click the downloaded installer.
- Check the box that says "Add Python X.X to PATH" during installation. This option ensures that Python is added to the system PATH, allowing you to run Python from the command prompt easily.
- Click "Install Now" to proceed with the installation.

**Step 3: Installing Python on macOS:**
- Open the downloaded package (.dmg) file.
- Run the Python installer by double-clicking the Python.mpkg file.
- Follow the installation instructions, and Python will be installed on your system.

**Step 4: Installing Python on Linux:**
- Most Linux distributions come with Python pre-installed. You can check if Python is available by opening a terminal and typing `python3 --version` or `python --version`.
- If Python is not installed or you need a specific version, use your package manager to install Python. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use `sudo apt-get install python3` to install Python 3.

**Step 5: Verify the Installation:**
- Open a terminal (Command Prompt on Windows) and type `python3 --version` (or `python --version` on some systems). This should display the installed Python version.
- To launch the Python interactive shell, simply type `python3` (or `python` on some systems) in the terminal and press Enter. You should see the Python prompt (`>>>`), indicating that the Python interpreter is running.

**Step 6: Setting up a Text Editor or IDE:**
- For writing Python code, you'll need a text editor or an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). Some popular choices include Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, Sublime Text, and Atom.
- Choose an editor that you are comfortable with and install it on your system.

Once you have Python installed and a text editor or IDE set up, you're ready to start writing Python code. You can use the text editor/IDE to create Python files with a .py extension and run them using the Python interpreter.

For example, you can create a file named `hello.py` with the following content:

```python
print("Hello, Python!")
```

Save the file and run it from the terminal using the command `python3 hello.py` (or `python hello.py` on some systems).

Congratulations! You've successfully installed Python and set up your development environment. Now you're ready to start learning Python and solving exercises. If you encounter any issues during the installation process, feel free to ask for help. Happy coding!
